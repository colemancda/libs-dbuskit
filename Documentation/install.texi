@chapter Installation Instructions

@section Required software

As an Objective-C framework, DBusKit depends on recent versions of the
GNUstep Makefile Package and the GNUstep Base Library. Versions 2.4.0
and 1.20.0 (respectively) are known to work. D-Bus support is provided
by libdbus. DBusKit has been verified to work with version 1.2.1 of
libdbus, but might work with earlier versions. To build the testsuite,
the UnitKit framework is required. It is available from the Étoilé
@uref{http://svn.gna.org/svn/etoile/trunk/Etoile/Frameworks/UnitKit/,
repository}.

@itemize @bullet
@item gnustep-make (>=2.4.0)

@item libdbus (>=1.2.1)

@item UnitKit (optional)
@end itemize

@section Build and Install

automatically configure the framework prior to building and installing.
